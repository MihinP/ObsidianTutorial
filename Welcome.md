## Dataview
[Dataview (blacksmithgu.github.io)](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) 

Dataview allows you to search through notes and generate tables populated with relevant information and metadata. For example, a list with subject home pages from the folder "Subjects"

```dataview
List
From "Subjects"
```
#### A table with semester and exam dates

```dataview
Table semester as "Semester", exam as "Date of Exam"
from "Subjects" 
```


#### Maybe you want to know how long until the exam and sort it

```dataview
Table
exam - date(today) as "Days Until Exam"
from "Subjects"
sort exam - date(today) asc
```

#### What if we search for all notes containing the #subject

```dataview
Table semester as "Semester"
from #subject  
```


## Tasks
[Introduction - Tasks User Guide - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction)

```







## Templater
[GitHub - SilentVoid13/Templater: A template plugin for obsidian](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
Obsidian natively supports templates for automating note creation, however this plugin greatly expands templates to automate everything from file names to links

Templates follow a very specific syntax found here [Introduction - Templater (silentvoid13.github.io)](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)which is quite complex and daunting for new users

I would recommend following other people's templates online for whatever functionality you need but [[Subject Template|here is an example to get started]]

`Ctrl + P` to open the command palette and search "Subject Template". This will create a new note in "Subjects"
Type the new name of the note when created and hit `Enter`


You will see your new note in the folder and also (for example) in something like [[Subjects Homepage]]

## Automatic Daily Task List
Obsidian can be set up to automatically create a note for each day with all tasks you need to complete
Instructions can be found here
https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/

An example of what this looks like in practice

The template I use for my notes [[Daily Note Template]]

## Literature Database
I have set up Obsidian to extract papers and my annotations from my Zotero reference manager
An example of what this looks like
![[Pasted image 20240123184024.png]]
Install the following plugin - https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration

Follow Section 1 of the following link
https://archive.md/IscNA and use the template below

This assumes an understanding of Zotero (including highlighting and annotating within Zotero, managing files and updated bibtex exports)

Here is the [[Literature Note Template]] I use
